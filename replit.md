- **Database Models** (`models.py`): SQLAlchemy models for users, devices, logs
- **USB/IP Utilities** (`usbip_utils.py`): Core device management functions
- **Virtual Storage** (`virtual_storage_utils.py`): Virtual USB device file management

### Key Features
- Enhanced USB device binding and publication capabilities
- Advanced real-time monitoring for local and remote USB devices
- Intelligent error detection and recovery mechanisms
- Cross-platform device compatibility with detailed diagnostic tools
- English-only interface for simplified maintenance and consistency
- Streamlined installation and uninstallation processes
- Improved session and error handling for API requests

## Recent Changes

### October 25, 2025
- **Complete Russian Translation Removal**: Removed all Russian language support for English-only interface
  - Deleted `translations.py` file (653 lines) containing Russian/English translation dictionaries
  - Replaced 307 `t()` function calls across 11 HTML templates with direct English text
  - Removed language selector UI components from `base.html`, `login.html`, and `admin.html`
  - Removed translation functions from `app.py`: `get_current_language()`, `inject_translation()`, `/set_language` route
  - Updated device type labels in virtual devices page with English descriptions
  - Simplified logout message handling (removed conditional Russian/English logic)
  - Created automation script (`remove_translations.py`) for bulk t() replacements
  - Synchronized all changes between Replit and GitHub repository

  - Added comprehensive debugging and console logging for troubleshooting
  - Enhanced server-side request logging with detailed headers and form data
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed busid mismatch - now uses `usbip list -l` instead of `lsusb`
  - Device busid from `lsusb` (1-5) didn't match `usbip` requirements (1-8)
  - Updated get_local_usb_devices() to prioritize usbip list -l for correct busid
- **Device Name & Status Display Fix**: Fixed device name parsing and publication status detection
  - Improved usbip list -l parsing to extract proper device names from multi-line format
  - Fixed "Unknown Device" issue - now shows "Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd : unknown product"
  - Enhanced get_published_devices() function with detailed logging for status detection
  - Added proper multi-line parser for device name extraction from usbip output
  - **BACKUP CREATED**: orange-usbip-backup-20250709-012300.tar.gz with all latest fixes
- **Full Device Names Integration**: Combined lsusb full names with usbip correct busid
  - Enhanced get_local_usb_devices() to merge data from both lsusb and usbip list -l
  - Now displays complete device names: "MosArt Semiconductor Corp. Wireless Keyboard/Mouse"
  - Maintains correct busid format from usbip for proper device binding
  - Shows VID:PID format consistently across interface
  - Fallback system when either lsusb or usbip commands fail
  - Updated home2.html template to display full_name field with proper formatting
  - **CONFIRMED WORKING**: User reports full device names now display correctly
- **SQLAlchemy Compatibility Fix**: Updated code to work with SQLAlchemy 1.4.50 (Ubuntu system version)
  - Changed import from `DeclarativeBase` to `declarative_base` for compatibility
  - Fixed base class creation to use `declarative_base()` instead of class inheritance
  - Resolved service startup failures caused by SQLAlchemy version conflicts
  - Created diagnostic scripts (`fix_dependencies.sh`, `fix_sqlalchemy_conflict.sh`) for installation troubleshooting
- **Installation Script Recovery**: Restored working `install_debian.sh` from backup after debugging issues
  - Identified critical bugs in enhanced version that caused premature script termination
  - Successfully restored stable version from `install_debian_old.sh`
  - Both files now contain identical, working installation script
  - Maintained backup system for future enhancements
- **Interactive Removal Script**: Created `check_and_remove.sh` for service and application cleanup
  - Comprehensive English-language interactive script for checking and removing Orange USB/IP
  - Detects and removes orange-usbip and usbipd services with user confirmation
  - Checks for application directories in multiple locations with size reporting
  - Terminates running processes with user approval
  - Provides detailed status reporting and final system verification
  - **Final Command**: Confirmed only working command: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maksfaktor/usbip-web/main/check_and_remove.sh -o check_and_remove.sh && chmod +x check_and_remove.sh && sudo ./check_and_remove.sh`
  - **Installation Script Hanging Fix**: Removed automatic usbipd service start during installation
    - Fixed issue where installation would hang indefinitely on `systemctl start usbipd`
    - Installation now only checks service status without attempting to start it
    - Service is enabled during installation and can be started manually after completion
    - Provides clear instructions for manual service management if needed
  - **Doctor.sh Simplification**: Removed interactive network connection test section
    - Deleted Section 9 "Network Connection Test" from doctor.sh diagnostic script
    - Eliminated user prompt for remote server IP address testing
    - Streamlined diagnostic flow to focus on local system checks only
  - **Database Configuration Fix**: Fixed 500 error after login by correcting SQLite configuration
    - Resolved circular import issues between main.py and app.py
    - Restored proper SQLite-only configuration (removed PostgreSQL references)
    - Fixed admin user creation logic to work correctly with SQLite
    - Corrected 500 error after login on production installations
- **Terminal Page Implementation**: Created comprehensive web terminal with command execution
  - Added `TerminalCommand` model for storing custom command buttons
  - Implemented terminal interface with keyboard support and command history
  - Added command button management (create, edit, delete)
  - Integrated multilingual support for terminal functionality
- **Translation System Fixes**: Fixed all `translate()` function calls to use `t()` 
  - Corrected function usage in `terminal.html`, `home2.html`, and navigation
  - Added complete Russian and English translations for terminal features
- **New Application Icon**: Created custom orange fruit SVG icon (`static/orange-icon.svg`) to match Orange Pi branding
- **Updated Templates**: Modified `base.html` and `login.html` to use new orange icon
- **Enhanced Home2 Page**: Added `/home2` route with simplified USB device management interface
- **Improved Logging**: Added detailed debug logging for device publication tracking

### Previous Updates
- Enhanced get_published_devices() function with multiple detection methods
- Fixed JavaScript syntax errors in API responses
- Created simplified alternative interface (home2.html)
- Added comprehensive diagnostic capabilities with doctor.sh integration
- Implemented automated installation scripts for ARM and x86 architectures
